<h1 align="center"> Welcome I'm Rabah ACHOUR </h1>

<h3 align="left">I'm a Data science student at Paris-Saclay University (Orsay)</h3>

- I put my interest on decisionnal methods in Information Systems, especially Data Mining and Operation Research.

- In my apprenticeship, i worked on the **Data management** of projects that use **Large Language Models** for Code engineering in automated program repair (APR), like code-based **RAG**. It requires identification of the good data, data analytics to choose the best metadata to include in embeddings and intelligent transformation of source code as a data for LLM context.

- For now, my Github is on building... You will find some of my projects on it.
